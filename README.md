🧭 Blockchain-Based Information System for Trustworthy and Sustainable Supply Chains

This project develops a transparent, verifiable, and trustworthy information system that leverages blockchain technology and open data to strengthen trust and sustainability in global supply chains.

The prototype captures and visualizes key events across the entire supply chain — from production to delivery — while ensuring the integrity, authenticity, and immutability of each transaction through blockchain anchoring.

🔧 Core Features

🌐 Open Data Integration – combines datasets from Open Supply Hub, ESG reports, and public registries

🔗 Blockchain Simulation – implemented with Ethereum, Hardhat, and web3.py to ensure data immutability

🧮 Data Modeling – PostgreSQL or Neo4j for representing Product → Batch → Facility → Event relationships

✅ Data Validation – powered by Great Expectations for consistency and quality assurance

📊 Interactive Dashboard – built with Streamlit and Leaflet.js for real-time supply chain visualization

🎯 Goal

Deliver a working prototype that demonstrates how blockchain and open data can create transparency, traceability, and ethical accountability in modern information systems for sustainable supply chains.
